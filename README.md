# Web-Executable-Loader

This is a basic "loader", which simply decodes Base64 encoded strings that are the download links for executables, that are then placed into a file path as .scr (screen saver file) extension and then opened. This repository contains the downloads of each executable, the source code of the project and the website which was hosted via GitHub Pages.
